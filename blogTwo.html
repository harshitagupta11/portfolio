                <h1>More about second dummy blog</h1>
            <small>November, 2020</small>
            <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum',
                 which is said to have originated in the 16th century. 
                 Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language
                  which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
                   It contains a series of real Latin words.</p>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be di
    stracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
     distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages 
      and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
       and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
       their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes 
       by accident,
     sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
